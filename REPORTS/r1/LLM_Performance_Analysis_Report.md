## 2. Advanced Statistical Analysis

### 2.1 Confidence Intervals

#### Methodology Explanation
Confidence intervals provide a range of values that likely contain the true population parameter. A 95% confidence interval means that if we repeated this experiment 100 times, approximately 95 of those intervals would contain the true success rate. This helps us understand the reliability and precision of our measurements.
