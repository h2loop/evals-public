### 4.1 Key Statistical Metrics

#### 4.1.1 Confidence Intervals (CI)

**What it is**: A confidence interval provides a range of values that likely contains the true population parameter with a specified level of confidence (95% in our case).

**Why we use it in LLM evaluation**:
- **Uncertainty Quantification**: LLM performance varies across different problems; CIs account for this sampling variability
- **Reliable Comparisons**: Helps distinguish between genuine performance differences and random variation
- **Decision Making**: Provides bounds for expected performance in real-world deployment scenarios

**Formula**: `CI = x̄ ± (t_{α/2,df} × SE)` where SE = s/√n

**Comprehensive 95% Confidence Intervals (Calculated from Real Data):**

![Confidence Intervals](confidence_intervals.png)

**Key Observations:**
- **H2looP's Performance Variability**: Moderate confidence intervals indicate consistent but domain-dependent performance
- **Gemini Pro's Consistency**: Narrow intervals show reliable performance across problem types
- **Validation Quality**: H2looP achieves high validation success when builds succeed

#### 4.1.2 Effect Size Analysis (Cohen's d) - Complete Comparison Matrix

**What it is**: Effect size measures the magnitude of difference between two groups, independent of sample size. Unlike p-values, it tells us how practically meaningful a difference is.

**Why we use it in LLM evaluation**:
- **Practical Significance**: Statistical significance (p < 0.05) doesn't guarantee practical importance
- **Resource Trade-offs**: Helps determine if performance gains justify computational costs
- **Model Selection**: Quantifies whether switching models provides meaningful improvements
- **Standardized Comparison**: Enables comparison across different metrics and studies

**Formula**: `d = (μ₁ - μ₂) / σ_pooled`

**Interpretation Scale**:
- Negligible: |d| < 0.2 (difference barely noticeable)
- Small: 0.2 ≤ |d| < 0.5 (noticeable to experts)
- Medium: 0.5 ≤ |d| < 0.8 (visible to careful observers)  
- Large: |d| ≥ 0.8 (obvious to casual observers)
