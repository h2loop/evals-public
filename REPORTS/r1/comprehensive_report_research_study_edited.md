## Abstract

This report presents a comprehensive empirical analysis of 11 state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) evaluated on the ParEval benchmark for parallel code generation. Our research focuses on serial and MPI parallelization paradigms, examining performance variations across models with particular attention to resource efficiency and code quality metrics. The study reveals significant performance differentials, with our in-house H2looP models (H2LooP-v0.1-coder and H2LooP-v0.1-multimodal) demonstrating best-in-class performance. We also benchmarked our models against the world's frontier coding LLMs, witnessing competency on par with them, while requiring substantially fewer computational resources.

**Formula**: `d = (μ₁ - μ₂) / σ_pooled`

**Interpretation Scale**:
- Negligible: |d| < 0.2 (difference barely noticeable)
- Small: 0.2 ≤ |d| < 0.5 (noticeable to experts)
- Medium: 0.5 ≤ |d| < 0.8 (visible to careful observers)
